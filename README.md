  - Full control over nodes and edges (add, remove).
  - Save and load graph designs.
  - Apply algorithms on the designed graphs.
  - Live adjacency matrix generation.
  - Take screenshots of your graph designs.

- **Tree Designer**
  - Add root and child nodes.
  - Remove nodes as needed.
  - Save and load tree designs.
